# Nav Code Challenge

- [Flutter version] 3.22.1
- [Dart version] 3.4.1

## Project Description
This project aims to integrate with the GetSiteMenu endpoint of Wendy's, which provides detailed information about the restaurant's menu. The API returns a large amount of data, but for the purposes of this project, we will focus on extracting only the essential information.

By analyzing the JSON response returned by the endpoint, we aim to facilitate the understanding and manipulation of the menu data, allowing for a clear and efficient presentation of the options available to users. This project focuses not only on technical integration but also on architectural solutions, testing, and the implementation of pipelines.
